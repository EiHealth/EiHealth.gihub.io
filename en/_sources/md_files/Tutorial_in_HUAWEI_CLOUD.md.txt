# A Tutorial of Using AutoGenome from HUAWEI CLOUD

AutoGenome is freely available from HUAWEI CLOUD EIHealth and ModelArts Platform. This is a tutorial of running AutoGenome from HUAWEI CLOUD ModelArts and EIHealth Platform.

## Use AutoGenome from HUAWEI CLOUD ModelArts

AutoGenome is now freely available to public users from HUAWEI Cloud ModelArts AI platform. Registered users could use the free notebook services to test AutoGenome (The one hour free GPU quota is sufficient for most genome AutoML tasks). 

Here is a short tutorial of how to launch AutoGenome from the free notebook services on ModelArts. 

### Step 1: Log in

Access [HUAWEI CLOUD ModelArts](https://console.huaweicloud.com/modelarts/?region=cn-north-4&locale=en-us#/dashboard) and enter your username and password. And Click “**Log In**”. Please register an account if you don’t have one.

### Step 3: Specify the notebook environment

In the new page, specify the name of environment, chose “Python2” for “Work Environment”, chose “GPU” for “Type”, chose “[Limited-time free] GPU:1*p100 CPU” for “Instance Flavor”, then click “**Next**”.

## Use AutoGenome from EIHealth Platform

HUAWEI EIHealth is the healthcare AI platform for genomic research, clinical research and drug discovery. This is a short tutorial of how to use AutoGenome from EIHealth. 

### Step 1: Log in

Access [EIHealth](https://eihealth.ai/) (This is a demo site, if your company or institute purchased EIHealth, it will be from a different URL) and enter the registered username and password, then Click “**Log In**”, you can also switch to Chinese language.
